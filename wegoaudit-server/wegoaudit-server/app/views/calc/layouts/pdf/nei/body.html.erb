  <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>
  <p>
    This report does not assure financial savings, energy savings, or
    building upgrades. Financial and energy savings depend on many
    interrelated variables: building performance, quality of contractor
    installations, job costs, operations and maintenance, tenant behavior,
    weather, and energy prices.  Achieving energy savings will require a
    concentrated and proactive approach on the part of the building owner,
    e.g., by following best practices in operations and maintenance,
    performing basic upgrades (weatherstripping, compact fluorescent
    lamps), educating tenants about the impact of their behavior on energy
    consumption, and pursuing smart upgrades and retrofits. This report
    should not be used for specifying upgrade techniques or methods.
  </p>

  <p>
    The contents of this report should not be construed as assuring any
    energy savings, investment, or financing for upgrades. The results,
    assessments, conclusions, and recommendations stated herein are
    factually representative of the conditions and circumstances observed
    in accessible building areas on the date of the assessment. We do not
    assume responsibility for building conditions found in inaccessible
    areas or any change in conditions or circumstances. This report and its
    findings and recommendations, if implemented by your firm, should not
    be construed as an assurance or implied warranty for the continuing
    safety, performance, or cost-effectiveness of any equipment, product,
    system, facility, procedure, or policy discussed or recommended herein.
  </p>

  <p>
    This report may contain sensitive information about your firm, staff,
    equipment, operations, or policies. It may also contain confidential or
    proprietary information about specific equipment or products that have
    been provided to New Ecology Inc. by the manufacturers or other sources.
    Therefore, we consider this report confidential and ask that you do the
    same. This report should not be transmitted to third parties without
    the written permission of New Ecology Inc. and an authorized agent of
    your firm. Asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paint, and other
    hazardous materials, such as mercury and PCBs in lighting ballasts, may
    be present in building materials. The Owner is responsible for
    identifying those materials that will be affected by the planned
    retrofit work. Licensed, insured, and experienced professionals should
    be retained to test, manage, remove, and dispose of all hazardous
    materials in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local
    regulations.
