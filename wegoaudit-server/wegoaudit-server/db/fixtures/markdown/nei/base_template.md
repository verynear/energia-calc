## Executive Summary

This  report  presents  the  results  of  an  energy  and  water  audit  completed  for  {{ building_name }},  located at {{ building_address }}, {{ building_city }} {{ building_state }}. Based on its analysis, NEI concludes that there are strong opportunities for utility  consumption  and  cost  savings  at {{ building_name }}. NEI  has  assembled  a  list  of  recommended upgrades  intended to  assist {{ contact_company }} with decisions concerning the building's resource efficiency. These    upgrades    are summarized in Table 1 below,  and are ordered  from highest to lowest savings-to-investment ratio (SIR). Each of the upgrades is discussed in detail in the section titled Energy and Water Upgrades.

#### Table 1: Energy and Water Conservation Project Summary

{% financial_summary %}

These upgrades will produce the estimated energy and water savings outlined in Table 2.

#### Table 2: Summary of Energy and Water Savings

{% nei_usage_summary %}

As part of the audit process, NEI has performed an analysis of the buildingâ€™s historical energy  and water  consumption  data.  The  results  of  this  analysis  are  presented  in  Appendix  1.

{% contentblock assessment_notes %}

Appendix 2 contains a summary of the existing conditions found during the  assessment.  Appendix  3  contains  lifecycle  costing  sheets  used  to  determine  the  financial viability of each proposed upgrade.

#### Energy and Water Upgrades

NEI  has  developed  a  set  of  recommended  upgrades  that  will  reduce  energy  and  water  use  at {{ building_name }}.  These  upgrades  are  listed  below and  are  ordered  from  highest  to  lowest SIR  value. Please  note  that  the Estimated  Upfront  Cost values found under each upgrade do not include the Estimated Incentive values  listed immediately after, since monetary incentives are highly variable and may change from time to time. See the Incentives section for further discussion.

*Important Note: The recommendations in this report are based on a visual inspection of the buildings and  systems,  historical  energy  and  water  use  analysis,  and  cost  and  savings  estimates  made  by  NEI. Cost and savings estimates are based on the professional judgments of NEI. They are not based on bids or  quantifiable  estimates,  and  are  not  guaranteed.  This  report  does  not  constitute  an  engineering design  of  building  systems.  Additional  design  work  and  product  choices   may  be  needed  before implementing any of the recommendations found below.*
